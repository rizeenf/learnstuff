# learnstuff

Every single stuff that idk where to put it on, so i decided to put it here, heres the stuff:
  - useState (done)
  - useReducer (done)
  - useContext (done / not in this repo)
  - useRef (done / not in this repo)
  - useEffect (done / not in this repo)
on going to learn:
  - useCallback
  - useMemo
  - Redux
  - API Calls (GraphQL - Apollo i think) (REST - Axios or SWR maybe)
  - Testing (idk what todo)
  - Typescript (for sure)
  - Framework (Next.js sounds like a good idea)
